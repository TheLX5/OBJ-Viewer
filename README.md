## OBJ Viewer
A small python script that lets you preview OBJ data if the required files are provided.

**REQUIREMENTS**
* Python 3 with Tkinter and Ttk (I forgot which version comes with Ttk, do your research)

**NOTES**
* I'm not very proficient at high level languages so a lot of the code is REALLY bad and poorly thought out
* It's really slow when there's a lot of OAM tiles being drawn on the screen
* It may spam a little bit your console if you go out of bounds of the VRAM area
